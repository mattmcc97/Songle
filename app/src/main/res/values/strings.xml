    Move around the map and collect lyrics by clicking on nearby markers.
    Use these lyrics to guess the song.
    Press the guess button, on the map, when you think you\'ve got it!\n\nYou\'ll get points for every marker you collect.
    The more points you get, the higher level you will become.
    As you increase your level, the game will become harder.\n\nFor every 1km you walk, you will receive a Songle coin.
    You can use your Songle coins to reveal any lyric you want.
