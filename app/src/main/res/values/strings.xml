    Move around the map and collect words by clicking on nearby markers.\n\nMarkers on the map have
        different colours depending on how interesting they are:
        \n\nBoring words - Cyan/Light blue\n\nNot boring words - Yellow\n\nInteresting words -
        Orange\n\nVery interesting words - Red\n\nYou\'ll get points for every marker you collect.
        Collect
        more points for more interesting markers!\n\nEach marker contains a word inside it, use
        these words to guess the song.\n\nPress the guess button, on the map, when you think you\'ve
        got it!\n\nThe more points you get, the higher level you
        will become.
    As you increase your level, the game will become harder.\n\nFor every 1km you walk, you will
        receive a Songle coin.
    You can use your Songle coins to reveal 10 random words on a song of your choice.
